While my projects are minor, I'll keep posting on my progress.\r\n\r\n## A little about myself\r\n* I'm still learning a bit of coding, but I've developed a little skill in:\r\n  * Java - The first language I started learning, I was pretty decent until I stopped and forgot how to use it.\r\n  * Python - The \r\n  * HTML\r\n  * All of which I'm still currently learning\r\n* I play a few instruments, those being the violin for 6 years, and the piano for 2. Until I discovered programming I always thought I would major in the music industry.\r\n* I'm definitely an _**AVID**_ Cross Fitter. I will always set aside time to a workout and improve my fitness level.\r\n\r\n## A Big Note\r\nThis Website is still being developed,as I've just finished trying out [using GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) so changes should still be occurring periodically or when I manage to have the time.\r\n\r\n### Goals\r\n\r\n- [x] Make a GitHub account\r\n- [x] Start developing a Website of sorts\r\n- [ ] Become proficient at HTML\r\n- [ ] Become proficient at Python\r\n- [ ] Become proficient at Java\r\n- [ ] Become proficient at C++\r\n- [ ] Become proficient at CSS\r\n- [ ] Finish a website\r\n- [ ] Make it to Regionals at Cross Fit\r\n- [ ] Completed the list\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile.
